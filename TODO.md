# TODO

- [ ] Firefox misdetecting section boundaries


# Requirements

- [ ] Use world-110m GIS features, and load from a JSPM package
- [ ] Github should display markup reasonably
- [ ] Support for inline and standalone links (? maybe not)
- [ ] Highlight current section?  (in which case, viz tied to h2/h3 & never inline)
- [ ] Should be possible to bookmark at anchor *best supported via markdown heading anchors*
- [ ] Make the h1 into the page title/banner across the top
- [ ] Easy to determine which link is active


what if we pull visualisation links out to the side of the text

*JSON is nice, but would it be better to have a URL-like
format?*
